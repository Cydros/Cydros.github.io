## What you need to know about Kayn

### Who is Kayn
A peerless practitioner of lethal shadow magic, Shieda Kayn battles to achieve his true destinyâ€”to one day lead the Order of Shadow into a new era of Ionian supremacy. He wields the sentient darkin weapon Rhaast, undeterred by its creeping corruption of his body and mind. There are only two possible outcomes: either Kayn bends the weapon to his will... or the malevolent blade consumes him completely, paving the way for the destruction of all Runeterra.

## Abilities 

### Passive - The Darkin Scythe
Kayn wields an ancient weapon and fights Rhaast, the darkin within it, for control. Either the Darkin will triumph, or Kayn will master Rhaast and become the Shadow Assassin. Darkin: Heal for a percentage of spell damage dealt to champions. Shadow Assassin: For the first few seconds in combat with enemy champions, deal bonus damage.

### Q - Reaping Slash
Kayn dashes, then slashes. Both deal damage.

### W - Blades's Reach
Kayn damages and slows targets in a line.

### E - Shadow Step
Kayn can walk through terrain.

### R - Umbral Trespass
Kayn hides in an enemy's body, dealing massive damage when he bursts out.

# TIPS FOR KAYN BEGINNERS
You are the only one that can change modes in the middle of the game, so choose your side wisely. The darkin can heal through his skill and the Shadow Assasin can have faster movement speed and deals additional damage.

## Choose Darkin if...
ONLY choose darkin if there are a lot of tanky champions like Cho'Gath, Malphite, Blitzcrank, etc. Because the Darkin can heal with every skill that hits an enemy champion especially the Drakin's ult which heals you based on the enemy champions maximum health. Basically, use it on tanky champions.

## Choose Shadow assasin if...
ONLY choose shadow assasin if there are a lot of squishy champions like Ashe, Jinx, Lucian, Jhin, etc. You can flash Q quickly followed by an instant R and R reactivation. Engage at max range by using Q towards your target, then instantly use W and R as soon as it lands, then Q back onto your target. Basically, use it to kill champions that deal massive damage but are vulnurable.
